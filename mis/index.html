History: Ana Holmes, our CEO, and her college roommate founded Femployment in 2018. They found there was an obscene difference betwee how their male counterparts were
being hired and wanted to make a way to skrink the outstanding gap.  They have worked with many different foundations and organizations throughout the 4 years they have 
been running in order to provide the best experience possible for their users.  While the started off as a small online platform only catering to their college campus but have been 
able to grow to other college campuses in the surrounding area and expanding into surrounding states as well.  They have recently introduced customers with the ability
to rent out professional tools to suit anyone's needs.
