<br><b>Financing</b></br>
<br>Joining the platform comes at zero cost to the patrons.  It is only once services are being used that we start charging.  Venmo and PayPal are suffiecient ways to pay
for our services.  We also have a monthly and yearly plan available for employers that would like to contiuosly have access to canidates.  Resume reviews, mock interviews,and 
career fairs all have set prices. Renting business tools varies in price due to the varying types of goods being sold. There is also a weekly, monthly, and annual plan that can be 
set up for patrons using this service. </br> 

<br><b>Delivery</b></br> 
<br>Business clothes rentals are the only physical goods we have to deliver.  These can be sent to the patron within 3-5 business days and will include a fee for 
shiping and handling.  We do ship all across America but currently do not offer international shipping.</br>   

<br><b>Return Policies</b></br>
 <br>If you were to rent from us and the clothes did not fit they must be returned to us within 5 business days.  After that we will charge you for a weekly rental.  
We will provide a renturnn label in all deliveries because we do expect all rentals to be returned once they are no longer being used.  You will only be charged shipping and handling;
other charges will be dropped.  </br>
